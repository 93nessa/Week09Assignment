          <p>The amount of light a plant gets is crucial to their growth. Make sure they can get natural light if possible. Otherwise use a grow light close to your plants.</p>
          <p>Make sure you research the type of plant you have and how much light they need. Some might need full light so you can place close to the window. Others have sensitive leaves so you have to place them a couple of feet away from a window. </p>
